# MoveM

A toy project to :
  1. Learn and understand Android Architecture
  2. Track my little kid sleeping next door
  
  The project is a bare project without any code quality check, done overnight,  created when I needed a utility to get alert on my phone when my daugter sleeping next door moves.
  
  The project focus on the communication between Android App & Wear OS app, and show notifications base on certain conditions.
